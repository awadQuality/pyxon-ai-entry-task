# Sample English Document

## Introduction to Document Processing

This is a sample English document for testing the Pyxon AI Document Parser system.

## Features

The document parser includes the following features:

- Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Intelligent chunking strategies
- Arabic language support with diacritics
- Semantic search capabilities
- RAG-powered retrieval

## Technical Architecture

The system uses a dual storage approach:

1. **PostgreSQL** for structured metadata storage
2. **ChromaDB** for vector embeddings and semantic search

### Embedding Model

We use the multilingual sentence transformer model that supports over 50 languages including Arabic and English.

## Conclusion

This document demonstrates the system's ability to process and chunk English text effectively.
